# Speech Processing Lab Session

The instructions can be found in `./assignment.pdf`. The main goal is to build ten digit-wise HMM to recognize speech signal in digits (Dutch 0-9).

## Structure

## Get Started

Two `.mat` files are needed: `./test_layer8.mat` and `./train_layer8.mat`. These two files are the intermediate results generated in the bottleneck layer of a neural network (see assignment).
